# Work Day Scheduler

## Description

This easy-to-use website makes scheduling your work day a breeze. Each hour of the day has its own text box to enter and edit data on your schedule. The time blocks are color-coded, so it's easy to read and follow along with your schedule. Gray is for past events, green is for current events, and blue is for future events. This simple and modern design offers a distraction-free and calm environment for planning out your work day.
